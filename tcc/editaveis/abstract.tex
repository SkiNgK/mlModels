 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
  Parkinson's disease is a neurological disease that affects a large part of the world population, being mostly elderly people, although the effective reasons that cause the disease have not been discovered, its diagnosis is possible thanks to the evident signs caused by the presence of the disease, despite the means to validate this diagnosis are already given as sufficient there is still a need to obtain more information about the state of the patient with this disease for possible studies on it. To guarantee access to this information and to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, it is possible to use the concepts of Machine Learning that have been widely requested in several areas of knowledge, including health, for the solution of problems in different contexts. This course completion work implements a system called Preliminary Detector of Parkinson's Disease in which a Machine Learning model is applied to aid in the preliminary diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease using samples collected by sEMGs devices in order to recognize patterns and obtain new information on the disease in question, using a proposal of methodology of construction of Machine Learning system. The system uses the Random Forest algorithm to detect disease patterns, since it was more successful in comparison to other models studied in this study.
